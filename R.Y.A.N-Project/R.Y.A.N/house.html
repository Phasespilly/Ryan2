                <p>R.Y.A.N. recently purchased the former Knights of Columbus building located on Barclay Street on Route 9W in Saugerties, NY. We have created a plan to renovate the property into a self-sustaining safe, sober, supportive home for individuals who are in recovery and are working to establish themselves back into the community. Under this plan the house will have a person in long-term recovery to oversee and manage the house. Each resident must be employed, they will pay rent, do chores and maintenance, cook for themselves, and basically live at the “R.Y.A.N. House” until they are secure financially, and secure in their recovery to live more independently.</p>

                        There’s not a person in our community that hasn’t been affected by addiction…a family member, a neighbor, a friend. This project is an opportunity to help those afflicted, free them of the cycle of social services, help them get back on their feet, and become a productive contributing member of the community. We are asking you to consider a donation of $1000, $5000, or $10,000 or perhaps a donation of some other resource. Please download and print our Donation Form for you if you would like to support us. Please fill out the form and send it with your tax deductible donation to the address listed.

                    <p>R.Y.A.N. has worked hard to hold community fundraisers to pay for the project, but we will need pledges for financial support and/or other resources to reach our goal. Our efforts, along with the pledges from several businesses, have already helped us to surpass $266,000. We are $84,000 away from purchasing the house, and we hope to achieve the targeted $500,000 necessary to get the building in operation as soon as possible.</p>
